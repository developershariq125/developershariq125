Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mohammad Shariq, a passionate 17-year-old Frontend Developer with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and WordPress. I'm currently learning 3.js, React Three Fiber, and React Native to expand my capabilities and create immersive user experiences.

As a first-year student, I'm actively looking for internship opportunities to gain industry knowledge and elevate my skills. My ultimate goal is to become a Full Stack Developer and Data Scientist, and I dream of building a beautiful masjid for Pakistan. Iâ€™m also committed to donating $1 million to Palestine as part of my vision to make a positive impact.

Thank you for visiting my profile â€“ let's connect and create something amazing!
